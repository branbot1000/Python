TAF is a Text Adventure Framework coded in Python. It is similar to the old school Zork games. This idea was created when I was trying to teach my son Python and he wanted to create a simple game.

The framework uses a simple adventure.cfg file in which you create a situation, actions to perform in the situation, then the results of each action.
